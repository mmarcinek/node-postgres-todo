# This is a another To-Do list

## It is built with Angular.js on the frontend
##    ******* a Node.js Server and ********
##    ****** a PostgresSQL database. ******

To get all node dependencies run `npm install`.

Please refer to package.json to see a full list of dependencies.

This To-Do list represents my first attempt at building out a full CRUD application from a RESTful backend API through to a responsive, interactive front-end application. I have enjoyed learning how to build out tables on PostgresSQL and learning how to write a server script in Node.js.

To build out this application, I followed this tutorial:

`http://mherman.org/blog/2015/02/12/postgresql-and-nodejs/#project-setup`

And I am incredibly thankful for Michael Herman's thorough walkthrough of building out a set of simple Node routes and a basic PostgresSQL database. I found the tutorial to be incredibly helpful, his basic Angular set-up is a really great tool as well.
